### Why I created this?
I personally love internet and almost everything that comes associated with it. It made our(atleast mine) lives far easier than what it was for previous generations. Though with the advent of internet also came many issues. One is, anybody can buy a domain, and they can end up using it for any purposes. There is no body to regulate what these purposes are. Scammers use this abilty to scam people money and and phish for personal data. While many of the current generation does know to a certain limit to easily identify what is legit and what's not, not everyone feels the same. For some it's not easy to verify what's legit, and whats scam. 
I think this will help them to identify it. Atleast, a very little bit. If this tool can help them protect their digital life atleast a very little bit, I think it's worth creating and maintaining it.
