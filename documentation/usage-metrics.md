<h2>authifyNow is private by default.</h2> 
<p>Privacy is something that is very important to the developer of this plugin, and hence every aspect of this plugin is developed with privacy in mind.</p> 
<p>We are not pprofiling you in any way. We don't know who the user is. We don't know what URL's the end user access. We simply don't want to know what URL's you visit and what purpose the browser serves you.</p>
<p>Although for improving our service, and to understand number of click the extension receives, we use minimal and private analytics tools namely, <a href="https://counter.dev/" target="_blank"> counter.dev </a> and <a href="https://hits.sh/authifyweb.github.io/authifyURL_crx/" target="_blank"> hits.sh</a>. </p>

<p> The following images shows what kind of data is obtained. </p>
<p> hits.sh: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/rgqakkx.png" target= "_blank"> image </a> </p> 
<p> counter.dev: <a href= "https://i.imgur.com/AMSqbRQ.png" target="_blank"> Image </a> </p>

<p> The only analytics we need is the number of pop-up opens. Nothing more. So be it Naughty or Nice, your website visits are always private from us. </p>
<p>You can opt to use a <a href="https://protonvpn.com/" target="_blank" > VPN</a> if you like to protect yourself from your ISP snooping.</p>
